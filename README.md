Don't like server /say or even the /broadcast well I don't and I made this plugin
Now I bet you're asking is this just gonna be [BB] <Message>
Well no you can choose the colour and if you want the [BB]


#Commands

/BB - Broadcast a message to the server 

/BBToggle - Toggles if the [BB] tag is showing (per player)

/BBColours - Shows all of Minecraft's Colour Codes

/BBReload - Reloads the config file

#Perms

/BB - bb.broadcast

/BBToggle bb.toggle

/BBColours bb.colours

/BBReload bb.reload

#How to use

This plugin revolves around three commands /BB, /BBToggle and /BBColours
To broadcast "Hello!" to the server type /BB Hello!.
To broadcast it in red type /BB &cHello! as the '&' tells the plugin the next digit is a Colour Code and the 'c' is the Colour Code for red.

To view all Colour Codes do /BBColours.

If you don't like the "[BB]" or feel the next broadcast will be better without it do /BBToggle and it toggles if the [BB] tag is shown.

#How to change the [BB] tag

Set the value 'tag' in your config to what you'd like the tag to be, it should include the default value in the config for an example.
